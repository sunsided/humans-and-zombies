# Toy Planning: "Humans and Zombies"

An implementation of search-based planning using the Humans and Zombies problem,
a version of the river crossing problem without the racism of "[Missionaries and Cannibals]"
and the sexism of "Jealous Husbands".

The problem statement, paraphrasing Wikipedia, is this:

> In the humans and zombies problem, three humans and three zombies must cross
> a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks,
> if there are humans present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by zombies
> (if they were, the zombies would eat the humans).
> The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.
